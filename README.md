Tropical Data Hub at JCU: Map Theatre
=====================================
![JCU Maps logo](blue-shadow.png "JCU Maps logo")

This is a theatre for data exploration that presents TDH data in a
spatial context.  Or as a normal human would say, shows stuff on a
map.

It's based on Terria Map, which powers the awesome
[NationalMap](nationalmap.gov.au).

To get started:

```
git clone https://github.com/jcu-eresearch/jcu-maps.git
cd jcu-maps
npm install      # Install dependencies, including gulp
npm start        # Start the server in the background
npm run watch    # Build the site, and watch for changes
```
